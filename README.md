# Articulation Disorder Classification

This code is accompanied with my thesis titled "Multimodal analysis of articulation disorders".

# How to use

To use this code, install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also make sure to replace the placeholder in app.py with your hugging face API token.

Code will keep trying until it succeeds as a workaround to the hugging face api throttles.
